## Triangle tracker Application
{This triangle tracker application allows a user interacting with it to know whether a triangle is an equilateral, isosceles, scalene or not a triangle.
I'd like to first mention that the biggest problems I encountered during this project were really stupid and idiotic typos; simple things like accidentally putting a colon where a semicolon belong (for the last method of a class of all cases!
Gave me weird errors about no constructor body) or dumb errors in my Makefile, which caused all sorts of weird compiling issues.
  }
## Setup/Installation Requirements:
     Have an up-to date web browser
     have a git-hub account
     have data bundles
     enjoy your tracking
## Behaviour Driven Development
      This application is based on the idea of naming a triangle depending on its length and sides. it has 4 feedbacks when you key in values in the input boxes. These are:
             Equilateral: All sides are equal
             Isosceles: Exactly 2 sides are equal
             Scalene: No sides are equal
             NOT a triangle: The sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle is less than or equal to the length of the third side
