## Triangle tracker Application
{This triangle tracker application allows a user interacting with it to know whether a triangle is an equilateral, isosceles, scalene or not a triangle.
I'd like to first mention that the biggest problems I encountered during this project were really stupid and idiotic typos; simple things like accidentally putting a colon where a semicolon belong (for the last method of a class of all cases!
Gave me weird errors about no constructor body) or dumb errors in my Makefile, which caused all sorts of weird compiling issues.
